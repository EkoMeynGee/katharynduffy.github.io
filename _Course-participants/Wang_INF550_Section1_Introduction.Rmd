Hi everyone, this is Hao Wang. I'm a new doctoral student of Informatics, I've finished my bachelor's and Master's degree in Electrical Engineering just this year. I'm currently living in Flagstaff, and I like computer stuff when I was free (coding, developing, gaming, etc). What I expect from this course is to enjoy the learning.
